# game_fizzbuzz
A guessing game based on the classic fizzbuzz guessing game.

# Instructions
* If you don't know what Fizzbuzz is,
it's a simple counting game, where numbers 
that are multiples of 3 and 5 are called
fizz or buzz, fizzbuzz if both.

* Simply put, replace that number with fizz,
buzz, or fizzbuzz depending on its respective
factor(s).

* If you guess incorrectly, no penalty
for you! You will not be awarded a point
however.

# To break it down
* Multiple of 3 (ex. 6, 9, 12) = fizz
* Multiple of 5 (ex. 5, 10, 20) = buzz
* Multiple of 3 AND 5 (15, 30, 45) = fizzbuzz

Here's fizzbuzz from 1 to 20:
